          <p>
            My name is Sipha Phaophongsavath! I also go by Dennis. I am the
            second youngest out of five kids. I was born and raised in Kearns
            Utah. Graduated from the University of Utah with my Bachelors in
            Physics. I am currently employed at a finance firm and have been
            there for almost nine months now.
 
            On my free time I like to break dance, go hiking, workout, work on
            my car, and hang out with my puppy named Harper. I was highly
            involved in high school and transitioning into the University. I
            teach break dancing during the season, I played rugby, a part of the
            ball room dance team, and was activily a part of a leadership
            organization at the U.
 
            I currently am an alumni for my leadership organization and perform
            with a dance company called Junction. I like to stay involved and
            participate in extracurricular activities. I listen to a lot of old
            school rap and hip hop such as NWA, Notorious BIG, Eazy-E, Erik B
            and Rakim etc.
